# Telegram Live Location Bot
This bot allows you to share telegram's live locations externally
<br>
It's already running at [@SwiperLiveLocationBot](https://t.me/SwiperLiveLocationBot) but you can run your own backend and custom frontend.

## Running your own backend
- Fill in [application.properties](https://github.com/MouamleH/tg-live-location-bot/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties)
- compile using `mvn clean compile package`
- upload the `libs` directory, and the `jar` file
- run the jar file
